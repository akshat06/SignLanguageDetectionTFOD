# SignLanguageDetectionTFOD
Sign Language Detection using TFOD
Hello!!
This Python notebook comprises of the code to detect the Sign Language Detection.

#### In our case we have used 5 Sign Languages which are Hello, Thanks, ILoveYou, Yes, No

We have used Tensorflow Object Detection i.e. TFOD for detecting the Sign Language and our model is trained on very few images i.e nearly 20 images of each category but the performance we get is quite satisfactory.
